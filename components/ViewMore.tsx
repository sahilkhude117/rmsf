          content={`The Ramanlal Maniyar Smruti Foundation was established to honor the life and legacy of Late Shri Ramanlal Maniyar, who dedicated himself to the welfare of others. Born into a well-respected family, Ramanbhai was always driven by a deep sense of empathy for those in need. He completed his education in Gadhinglaj and Sangli and was greatly influenced by the vision of leaders like Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru and Indira Gandhi. He also received guidance from Shri Dr. S.S. Ghali, who shaped his social work. Ramanbhai's unwavering belief in the power of education led him to start several businesses, creating job opportunities for the people of Gadhinglaj, while constantly encouraging the community to focus on learning and self-reliance.`}
